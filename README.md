# Deep Learning for Tabular Data

# I. Introduction

Our goal is to explore when deep learning is a better choice than more standard, tree-based, machine learning models. 
To do this we will use several large tabular datasets, including Titanic, ...
To evaluate what is best we will take into consideration the predictive performance, training time, inference time and requirements, explainability for each of the datasets.

# II. Background

Tabular data is data that comes in the form of a table, like a .csv file. The rows represent an observation, and colums represent the features, or the attributes of the observation. We want to predict one feature, the dependent variable, based on the data of the other features, the independent variables,

Tabular data is one of the most common types of data that we see in many real-world applications. It is also usualy easy to understand the data, you can use statistical and mathematical opperations, and there are good practices in place to explore and get the most knowledge out of the data.

If we were to go a non deep learning route, one would use decision trees, like random forest and gradient boosting. And probably an ensamble of theese.
